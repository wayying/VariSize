# VariSize
A dataset which includes five types of garments: T-shirts, cardigans, trousers, dresses, and skirts, with each type having four sizes.

Using a physics-based simulation method, we have created VariSize, the first 3D garment dataset containing various sizes across five categories: T-shirts, cardigans, pants, dresses, and skirts. Each garment category comprises more than 400 items across four sizes: S, M, L, and XL.
